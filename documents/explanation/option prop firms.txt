INTERACTIVE BROKERS 2K for margin account

	Options trading strategies involve different degrees of risk and complexity. Some riskier types of trades, like selling call options on stocks you don't own or writing an uncovered put option, can be made only on a margin account. However, less risky strategies, such as buying a call option, are allowed on cash accounts, too. Keep in mind that US brokers require you to have a minimum balance of $2000 to maintain a margin account.
